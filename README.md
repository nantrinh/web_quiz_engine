This project is modeled after the Web Quiz Engine project from [JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/).

Each lesson is located on a separate branch.

- [Lesson 1](https://github.com/nantrinh/web_quiz_engine/tree/lesson_1)
- [Lesson 2](https://github.com/nantrinh/web_quiz_engine/tree/lesson_2)

The solution for each lesson mainly uses concepts taught in that lesson.
